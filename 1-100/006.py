# sum square difference

# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 1^2+2^2+...+102=385

# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1+2+...+10)2=552=3025

# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
# natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
# one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
